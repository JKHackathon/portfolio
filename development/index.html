      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p>
        As a front-end developer, you often notice little features or behaviors
        on web apps that either spark a bit of joy or drive you absolutely
        crazy. When forming your own creation, you must strive to “steal”
        others’ good designs and make sure to steer clear from making the same
        mistakes.

      <h2>The Hunger to Find Good Features</h2>
      <p>
        This specific project focused on creating an aggregator of sorts that
        allows for a favoriting function, along with different filters. Given my
        love of food and the ever-present struggle of finding easy meals to
        cook, I decided to create a recipe app.
      </p>

    <div class="scroll-item">
      <p>
        Actually finding web apps with unique favoriting and sorting
        functionality proved rather challenging. Most are blocked behind login
        pages, and a lot are simply far too similar. After much searching, I
        decided upon Reddit, Spotify, and EdStem. All web apps I am
        well-familiar with while each serves a very different purpose.

        Each app indicates their saved items differently: Reddit having a
        separate tab for them, Spotify grouping saved songs in playlists, and
        EdStem by simply showing a star next to favorited posts. However, unlike
        the others, Reddit does not actually overtly indicate if a post is
        saved, requiring you to open up a menu to check its status. This simply
        indicates that saving posts is not a priority feature to Reddit.
        Furthermore, Reddit’s section for saved posts does not particularly
        stand out as it is amid many other categories, as you can see:

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section" style="height: 600px">
    <div class="scroll-item">
      <p>
        Both Spotify and Reddit had a nice feature where an alert banner
        notified you of your action. Spotify even took it a step further by
        allowing you to change that action by saving a song to a different
        playlist. While I am a big fan of quick undo buttons, I didn’t feel it
        would apply to my application.

        Edstem’s downside is that its filtering functionality is rather limited
        in terms of combining filters, which in my experience has often made it
        difficult to find specific posts.

        Overall, there are many different interesting design choices made by
        these companies in terms of the features they included and how they
        would portray them to users. While some served to simplify interactions,
        others, in my opinion, lacked intentional thought leading to a hindered
        experience.

      <h2>Whipping Up My Creation</h2>
      <p>
        After completing my research, it was time to create my recipe app. I
        decided to create cards for each recipe that included the key
        information in a relatively straightforward format. All the filtering
        categories are clearly indicated within this card, with the save button
        standing out due to its bright color. I chose to store all saved recipes
        in their own tab as this allowed for a consistent feel whether looking
        at all recipes or your saved recipes.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        Upon saving a recipe, a alert pops up just to make it even more clear to
        a user that they completed an action. As mentioned previously, I thought
        of including an “undo” option within the popup, however, I decided
        against it as the “save” button transitions to an “unsave” button which
        allows for users to easily change their mind.
