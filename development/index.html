      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p>
        As a front-end developer, you often notice little features or behaviors
        on web apps that either spark a bit of joy or drive you absolutely
        crazy. When forming your own creation, you must strive to “steal”
        others’ good designs and make sure to steer clear from making the same
        mistakes.

      <h2>The Hunger to Find Good Features</h2>
      <p>
        This specific project focused on creating an aggregator of sorts that
        allows for a favoriting function, along with different filters. Given my
        love of food and the ever-present struggle of finding easy meals to
        cook, I decided to create a recipe app.

        Actually finding web apps with unique favoriting and sorting
        functionality proved rather challenging. Most are blocked behind login
        pages, and a lot are simply far too similar. After much searching, I
        decided upon Reddit, Spotify, and EdStem. All web apps I am
        well-familiar with while each serves a very different purpose.

        Now for what we can improve. The title of the article reads almost like
        normal text as it is just slightly larger, while the subheaders are at
        least bolded, though the size should clearly separate them as well.
        There is also little distinction between the image captions and the main
        body. Strangely, despite the font choice being legible, the actual
        readability is not great, perhaps due to its light weight. Since
        grouping is primarily established through borders and dividers, the
        website feels a little old.

        There are also some problems that are less apparent. A number of images
        are missing alternative text, which allows for screen readers to
        describe what an image looks like. The links on the sidebar, such as in
        the “Watch Video” category, are also confusing for screen readers as the
        image and text are linked separately, resulting in difficulty navigating
        and understanding the structure of the webpage. Links in the sidebar
        also are not obviously clickable as there is no hover effect. Contrast
        in the navigation bar is also extremely low, making it difficult for
        even average users.

        And of course, the biggest issue: the webpage is completely
        unresponsive. This means that if you resize your window or use a
        different device, information will be cut off.

      <h2>Whipping Up My Creation</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever coming up with a design, I always start with some simple
        sketches to visualize how changes might look. After settling on a more
        tame sketch, I created a rudimentary wireframe for different devices
        that addressed most of the little issues we noticed. I made changes like
        removing borders between groups, italicizing captions, enlarging and
        bolding headers, creating cards to hold images and text for the sidebar
        links.

        Sidebars are always a bit of a challenge when it comes to mobile
        devices, as there are a lot of different options. I opted to move all
        the sidebar content below the main article as I felt this matched a lot
        of well-known existing designs. Ultimately, I wanted to maintain the
        general style of the original webpage as it has a little charm to it,
        but it needed to feel a little more modern and also have a more clear
        and consistent layout.

        Once I felt decently satisfied, I moved to a high-fidelity mockup, which
        would appear more like the finished product with all the colors and
        styling and logos added in, while still allowing for changes to be
        quickly made. I created a color palette based on the colors of a
        penguin, using a very dark blue for the main text and adding a couple of
        accent colors lacking in the original website, in order to more clearly
        highlight text. With this color palette and some new fonts in hand, I
        was ready.
